A share is the single smallest denomination of a company's stock. For example: Assuming you own shares of 2 companies, below is your current stock holding. 
You own 3000 shares of DBS's stock and 5000 shares of SIA's stock.

  Your current Stock Holding
   Stock  unit  price
   DBS    3000  22.360
   SIA    5000  4.230
   
When a share of common stock of some company is sold, the capital gain(or, sometimes loss) is the difference between the share's selling price and the price orginally 
paid to buy it.

This rule is easy to understand for a single share, but if we sell multiple shares of stock bought over a long period of time, then we must identify the shares 
actually being sold.

A standard accounting principle for identifying which shares of a stock were sold in such a case is to use a FIFO protocol - the shares sold are the ones that have been
held the longest (indeed, this is the default method)
